            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                As a motivated and enthusiastic fresher, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, web development, 
                and software engineering through academic projects and internships. My coursework and hands-on experience have 
                equipped me with proficiency in languages like Java, C, and Python, along with development tools such as Git, 
                GitHub, and VS Code. Additionally, I have worked on web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and 
                SQL, allowing me to build interactive and responsive web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my academic journey, I successfully completed projects like <strong>Bird Bounce Game</strong> and 
                <strong>Travel Guide</strong>, which enhanced my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and ability to work 
                in a structured environment. My internship in <strong>AI-ML Virtual Internship at AICTE-Eduskills</strong> further 
                refined my ability to learn new technologies quickly and apply them effectively. I am eager to leverage my skills 
                and knowledge to contribute to innovative projects and grow in a professional setting.
